# legendslinuxinstaller üçÅ

**Build Status: Pre-Alphaüçå** 

legendslinuxinstaller: A soon to-be MapleLegends Linux installer, launcher, toolbox, and configurator.

This installer is a bash script that automatically extracts the ML Wineskin, downloads (most) needed dependencies, sets up a custom wine prefix and creates a basic launcher. 

üõë Pre-Reqs
- Linux System running Wayland. (Steam Deck Included!)
- MapleLegends MAC Wineskin Download

‚úÖ Works
- Installs ML from the Wineskin with user prompts.
- Sets up the Wine Envrionment including Core Fonts in a separate wine prefix
- Creates a basic startlegends script in the install directory.
- lutris support

üö´ Doesn't Work/Todo
- TODO: X11 & Wayland HD2 support in progress.
    - Both involve running a second wine prefix with desktop emulation. This is planned.
- TODO: Auto-Audio Driver support. Need to create scripts to check for lib32 alsa/pipewire dependencies.
- TODO: Create configurable multiclient settings and environment.
- TODO: Create system bin for execution
- TODO: Create formal launcher.
